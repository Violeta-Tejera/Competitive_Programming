# Competitive_Programming
The aim of this repository is to store the solutions that I submit to various competitive programming platforms such as LeetCode.

Should you have any questions referring to my approach to them, suggestions or want to discuss any particular implementation, feel free to contact me at vtejmun@gmail.com
