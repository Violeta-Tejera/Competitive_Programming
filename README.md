# Competitive Programming
The aim of this repository is to store the solutions that I submit to various competitive programming platforms. The main web I have been working on has been LeetCode, although I'm now using some other webs like HackerRank and Acepta el Reto (This is an spanish web, it's name literally means "Accept the Challenge"), in the same fashion as Leetcode.

Should you have any questions referring to my approach to them, suggestions or want to discuss any particular implementation, feel free to contact me at vtejmun@gmail.com
